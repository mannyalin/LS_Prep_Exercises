// What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

// exception handling anticipates a possible error and shows that error when the conditions arise. It then continues with the code so that the code does not brake. The rest of the program can run even if there is an error for one part.

// Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable and predictable manner. It uses the try/catch statement to catch exceptions that the code in the try block raises, and lets the programmer deal with the problem in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents a catastrophic failure or nasty bug.
