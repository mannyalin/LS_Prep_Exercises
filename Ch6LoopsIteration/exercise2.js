/* Write a function that computes and returns the factorial of a number by using a for loop. The factorial of a positive integer n, signified by n!, is defined as the product of all integers between 1 and n, inclusive:

n!	Expansion	Result
1!	1	1
2!	1 * 2	2
3!	1 * 2 * 3	6
4!	1 * 2 * 3 * 4	24
5!	1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5	120
You may assume that the argument is always a positive integer.
